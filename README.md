# Cyberbullying-Detection-using-DeepLearning-and-NLP

## Aim:

The aim of this project is to develop a system for cyberbullying detection using deep learning models and Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project evaluates the performance of four deep learning models (RNN, CNN, CNN+LSTM, and CNN+GRU) for detecting cyberbullying from text data and compares their accuracy to determine the best-performing model.

## About:

The project focuses on creating a robust system capable of detecting cyberbullying in textual data. By leveraging NLP for text preprocessing and deep learning models for classification, the system can accurately identify harmful content, aiding in combating online harassment. Four models are compared—RNN (LSTM), CNN, CNN + LSTM, and CNN + GRU—to evaluate their performance in detecting abusive language, with the highest-performing model identified through accuracy metrics.The project includes tokenization, embedding, and training of models to identify patterns indicative of cyberbullying.

## Features

● Accurately classifies text as cyberbullying or not

● Evaluates and compares the performance of RNN, CNN, CNN + LSTM, and CNN + GRU models.

● Cleans text data by removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, digits, and stopwords

● Integration: Leverages embeddings and advanced architectures for better feature learning.

● Bar graph comparison of model accuracies.

● Provides model accuracy and loss visualizations for evaluation.

## Requirements:

● Programming Languages and Tools: Python (TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, NLTK, re, stopwords).

● Visualization: Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy.

● Hardware: CPU/GPU enabled system, sufficient RAM and storage for dataset and model training.

● Dataset: A labeled dataset containing textual data with annotated labels for cyberbullying (e.g., offensive, non-offensive).

● Deep Learning Models: RNN (LSTM), CNN, CNN + LSTM, CNN + GRU.

## Results and Impact:

Cyberbullying Detection using Deep Learning and NLP demonstrates the potential of deep learning models, especially CNN, in effectively detecting cyberbullying. It highlights the importance of advanced text analysis in fostering safer online environments and offers a foundation for developing automated tools to mitigate harmful online behavior.
This projecs shows that the CNN model achieved the highest accuracy in detecting cyberbullying, excelling in feature extraction and classification. While RNN (LSTM) and hybrid models like CNN+LSTM and CNN+GRU performed well, their added complexity did not surpass CNN’s efficiency and effectiveness, making CNN the most suitable model for this project.
